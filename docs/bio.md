### [2016-2023] Lectureships in Brazil

Between 2015 and 2016, **I applied for and secured Lectureships in three Federal Universities in Brazil**, the best-established university network in the country. In July 2016, **I declined the position at _Campina Grande_ ([UFCG](https://ufcg.br)) and took the position at _Paraíba_ ([UFPB](https://ufpb.br)) as a Lecturer in Algorithms**. In February 2017, **I moved to _Rio Grande do Norte_ ([UFRN](https://ufrn.br)) as a Lecturer in Big Data**, having taken an unpaid leave in late 2023. At UFRN, my research focused on **data science**, **AI**, and their effects on **socially relevant problems**, whereas my teaching activities focused on **computational thinking and data science for non-programmers**.

#### Research

- **I proposed and collaborated with applied data science projects with both the public and private sectors, comprising circa £3.5mi in total funding**. Partners included the **Brazilian Judicial Branch**, **Ministry of Education**, and **Public Safety Secretariats**, as well as **retail** and **energy companies**, e.g. **Neoenergia**, the Brazilian subsidiary of the Spanish utility company **Iberdrola**. 

- **I supervised graduate students on theses involving deep and automated machine learning**, as well as the intersection of **multi-objective optimization** with other CI domains, such as **multi-dimensional visualization** and **dynamic optimization**. The quality of those theses is evidenced by the **10 conference and two journal papers** published as a result, including an **EMO best paper award nomination**.

- **I developed a deep concern for socially relevant problems**, having for instance **assisted in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic through science publication and communication**. Importantly, my Lectureships led to **contributions to policymaking in public health, law (enforcement), and higher education**, e.g. the revised and updated **Brazilian Standard Classification of Education** for census, evaluation, and regulation.

#### Teaching

- **I have helped expand and restructure multiple postgraduate taught and research programmes**, increasing the number of academics, students, and research topics. As a result, the University created a novel **Professional Doctorate in Information Technology** and was able to improve the internationalization of the **PhD programme in Computer Science**. Importantly, several public partners sponsored cohorts for the **Graduate Apprenticeship in Information Technology** programme (MSc), e.g. the **Brazilian Judicial Branch**.

- **I have helped expand and restructure multiple undergraduate programmes**, namely the **BSc (Hons) in Information Technology**, the **BSc (Hons) in Computer Science**, and the **BSc (Hons) in Software Engineering**. As a result, the programmes now have **a broader focus on problem-solving through computational thinking**, as well as **minors in multiple tracks such as data science and artificial intelligence**. The relevance of these efforts is evidenced by **the programmes ranking among the best in the country** and **the creation of a BSc (Hons) in Artificial Intelligence**.

- **I designed and delivered course modules on data science and artificial intelligence for different levels of education
and coding proficiency**. The modules adopt a **project-based learning methodology, with external collaborators as stakeholders**. The relevance of these modules is evidenced by the **14 cohorts in 4 academic years** who took them, as well as **the book chapter organized by the LISA international network for statistical learning**.
