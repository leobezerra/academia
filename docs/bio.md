## Bio 

My **thesis on fundamental AI** resulted on **three journal and nine top-tier conference papers**, being seminal to my **Lectureships in Brazil**, where I worked **between 2016 and 2023** on **data science**, **AI**, and their effects on **socially relevant problems**.

- **I proposed and collaborated with applied data science projects with both the public and private sectors, comprising circa £3.5mi in total funding**. Partners included the **Brazilian Judicial Branch**, **Ministry of Education**, and **Public Safety Secretariats**, as well as **retail** and **energy companies**, e.g. **Neoenergia**, the Brazilian subsidiary of the Spanish utility company **Iberdrola**. 

- **I supervised graduate students on theses involving deep and automated machine learning**, as well as the intersection of **multi-objective optimization** with other CI domains, such as **multi-dimensional visualization** and **dynamic optimization**. The quality of those theses is evidenced by the **10 conference and two journal papers** published as a result, including an **EMO best paper award nomination**.

- **I developed a deep concern for socially relevant problems**, having for instance **assisted in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic through science publication and communication**. Importantly, my Lectureships led to **contributions to policymaking in public health, law (enforcement), and higher education**, e.g. the revised and updated **Brazilian Standard Classification of Education** for census, evaluation, and regulation.
