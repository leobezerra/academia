My thesis on \textbf{computational intelligence (CI)} was seminal to my current research on \textbf{data science (DS)}, \textbf{artificial intelligence~(AI)}, and their impact on \textbf{socially relevant problems}. Concerning DS, I supervise applied research projects with both the public and private sectors. Partners include the Brazilian Judicial Branch and Ministry of Education, as well as regional, national, and multi-national companies in fields as diverse as retail, telecommunications, and energy. Regarding AI, I supervise graduate students on theses involving deep and automated machine learning, as well as the intersection of multi-objective optimization with other CI domains, such as multi-dimensional visualization and dynamic optimization. Finally, regarding socially relevant problems, I have assisted in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic through science publication and communication, in attempt to counter the intensive disinformation campaign held in Brazil.

The water is seeded with small particles that are illuminated by a powerful laser. A cylinder is moved mechanically in various patterns mimicking theoretical 'free vibration' due to vortex shedding. The images are processed and analyzed in MATLAB and the resulting turblence/vorticity can be visualized. The forces experienced by the body are widely applicable (energy generation, structural pile requirements). Results were used in graduate student Erdem Aktosun's research.}

{This paper was the main contribution from the first Ph.D. thesis I co-supervised, and demonstrates how multi-objective and dynamic optimization intersect. The relevance of this paper is evidenced by its best paper award nomination at the EMO 2019 conference, where a preliminary version of the journal paper was first published. In addition, this paper is a concrete example of how I bridge different research topics into multi-disciplinary work.}  

\cventry{2021}{Comparing community mobility reduction between first and second COVID-19 waves}{Transport Policy}{h-index: 103}{}% IF: 6.173, 
{This paper was the main contribution of my efforts in science publication and communication to assist in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, the first author of this paper is one of the undergraduate students that I helped mobilize in those initiatives. The relevance of this paper is evidenced by the number of different continents and COVID-19 waves included in the assessment. In addition, this paper is a concrete example of how I use computational intelligence in the context of socially relevant problems. }

{These papers comprise the contributions of data science M.Sc. theses I (co-)supervised in partnership with public and private institutions. The relevance of these papers is evidenced by the socially relevant scenarios they address. In detail, the first paper focuses on the Brazilian Federal Network of Vocational, Scientific and Technological Education, which provides education to over two million students, with over half of the students that declared income, gender, and ethnicity coming from low income families, being women, and self-declaring as non-white. The remainder 2022 papers use AI techniques to model different business processes in the 3rd largest retail supermarket chain in the Northeast of Brazil, and is instrumental to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the industry. Finally, the 2018 papers address predictive policing to assist the local government in the forecasting of criminal occurrences.}

The relevance of these papers is evidenced by the state-of-the-art techniques that were employed. In addition, the application domains considered are among the most relevant that use unstructured data, namely computer vision, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. Importantly, these papers demonstrate that I understand the technological complexity of current state-of-the-art AI models, their potential impact on society, and therefore their need for accountability.}
